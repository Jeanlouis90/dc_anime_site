                <p>Despite being a huge anime fan, I am probably the last guy you want to get into a conversation with if your questions include the word season. You see, I don't ever follow an anime by season or whatever. I just go on animenewsnetwork or anime-planet or hell, I'll just go to Moviestop and just experiment a little, to get my anime fill. But after one long hang-out session with a pal o' mine, I found out two things.
                
                <ol>
                    <li>I haven't been rabidly downloading new anime since 2008. I'm a sad fucking excuse of an anime fan if I don't know what exactly most kids know about. I know, it's flawed logic, but this is running through my head. Couldn't catch it, out of shape, you get the memo.</li>
                    <li>If I'm going to work within this industry, I better get used to them CGI technologiez.</li>
                </ol>

                What I mean to say is this. I am a follower of the old-school. Everything I own if from the 60's-early 2000's. My favorite decade is the 80's for their City Hunters, obnoxious aliens, and North Star encrusted fists. That's just how I roll. I'm not a big fan of how newer shows require that a mech, car, or plane in question has to be a different dimension than everyone else. It's as though those poor animators forgot how to draw them or something (I know that surely is not the case). But I can hang with the newer stuff, and like I already said, I was relatively updated through torrents and discussion forums. Then College happened, and I kinda stopped posting about Pro Wrestling and Anime. This is the first anime post I've made since October 2008. Yeah.

                    So, my friend gets me started on the track to recovery with a few titles: <strong>Ano Hi Mata Hana No Namae O Bokutachi Wa Mada Shiranai</strong> (calling it Ano Hana from now on), <strong>Han Zemi</strong>, and <strong>Denpa Onna To Seishun Otoko</strong>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Synopsis</strong> - <em>Denpa Onna To Seishun Otoko</em> is a story about... you know what? I'll just quote it.</p>
                
                <p><em>
                    The story revolves around a highschool boy named Niwa Makoto. He lives with his aunt’s family since his parents are away on business. It is there where he meets his mysterious cousin of the same age Touwa Erio — who happens to tie a futon mattress around her upper body and is a self-proclaimed alien. Her staple food is pizza. Erio had been missing for half a year and was found floating in the sea. She doesn't remember anything about what happened during that period of time, but she began to think that it was the act of an alien and wanders the neighborhood wrapped in the futon.
